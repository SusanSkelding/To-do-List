# To-Do-List

	This is an interactive to do list.  
  
## how to use:

Clone the files to your local machine and open them in your prefered code editor, set it up on your local:8080 http server to preview the To-do list in action. 

## Future plans

I would like to add a "to done" list to the side that has the option to delete permamnently from there as well as icons to the input field.
